Blade Runner

Next subject, Kowalski, Leon, engineer, waste-disposal, file-section, new employees, six days.

(hears knock on door) Come in. (pause) Sit down.

Care if I talk? I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

Uh, just please don't move.

Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think
I've ever had one of these-

Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.
Now, answer as quickly as you can.

Sure.

One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.

That's the hotel.

What?

Where I live.

Nice place?

Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?

No, just warming you up, that's all.

Oh. It's not fancy or anything.

You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-

Is this the test now?

Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-

What one?

What?

What desert?

It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.

But how come I'd be there?

Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-

Tortoise, what's that?

Know what a turtle is?

Of course.

Same thing.

I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.

You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.

Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?

The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.

What do you mean I'm not helping?

I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.

My mother?

Yeah.

Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]

Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...

Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...

Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.

Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a

[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]

Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.

Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.

Hey, idi-wa.

Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

Got the wrong guy, pal.

Gaff:

Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.

Tell him I'm eating.

Gaff:

Bryant, huh?

[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]

climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...

The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him around. Bryant must
have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That jibberish he talked was
city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of Japanese, Spanish, German, what
have you. I didn't really need a translator. I knew the lingo, every
good cop did. But I wasn't going to make it easier for him.

...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.

[Bryant's office]

Hiya Deck.

Bryant.

You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.

Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.

They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.

Embarassing.

No sir. Not embarassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.

I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.

I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.

I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.

Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.

No choice, huh?

No choice pal.

--- [Video room]

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-

Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.

Leon (video): Yeah, sure.

Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.

Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.

Holden (video): What?

Leon (video): Where I live.

Holden (video): Nice place?

Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--

There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.

Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.

Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?

Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?

Leon (video): Of course.

Holden (video): Same thing.

Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.

I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?

Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.

[funny look]. [pause] What's this?

Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotion responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built in
a fail-safe device.

Which is what?

Four year life span.

Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.

And if the machine doesn't work?

[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]

Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.

[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]

Do you like our owl?

It's artificial?

Of course it is.

Must be expensive.

Very. I'm Rachel.

Deckard.

It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.

Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

May I ask you a personal question?

Sure.

Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

No.

But in your position that is a risk?

Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?

We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.

Where's the subject?

I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

What's that going to prove?

Indulge me.

On you?

Try her.

It's too bright in here.

[the window changes shade, letting less light in]

Do you mind if I smoke?

It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.

You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.

I take him to the doctor.

You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.

I'd kill it.

You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.

Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?

Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

Deckard (background): bush outside your window

I wouldn't let him.

Deckard (background): orange body, green legs

Why not?

I should be enough for him.

[audio fades out and in, time passes.]

One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progess. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.

Would you step out for a few moments, Rachel? (pause) Thank
you.

She's a replicant, isn't she?

I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?

I don't get it Tyrell.

How many questions?

Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

It took more than a hundred for Rachel, didn't it?

She doesn't know?!

She's beginning to suspect, I think.

Suspect? How can it not know what it is?

Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachel is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.

Memories. You're talking about memories.

[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]

Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.

Leon (video): Sure.

Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.

Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.

Holden (video): What?

Leon (video): Where I live.

Holden (video): Nice place?

Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?

Holden (video): No--

[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]

Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.

[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]

Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?

Someone was there.

Man? (pause) Policeman?

[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]

(mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)

Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.

(stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!

Yes, questions.

[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]

Morphology, longevity, incept dates.

Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.

Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.

I don't know answers.

Who does?

Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.

Tyrell corporation?

He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.

Ah, smart.

Cold.

Not an easy man to see--

Very cold.

I guess?

Sebastian he take-- take you there.

Sebastian who?

J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...

Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]

Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.

Leon (video): My mother?

Holden (video): Yeah.

Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]

Voice print identification. Your floor number please.

Deckard, ninety-seven.

Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.

I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.

What do I need help for?

I don't know why he told you what he did.

Talk to him.

He wouldn't see me.

Do you want a drink? No? No?

You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.

Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother,Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--

The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And they
ate her.

Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.

[Rachel runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]

Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachel. Right down to
a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to as
phony as Rachel's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect photos.
Maybe they were like Rachel. They needed memories.

[Deckard, on balcony.]

[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]

Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...

Hey! You forgot your bag.

I'm lost.

Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?

Pris.

Mine's J. F. Sebastian.

Hi.

Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?

I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?

We sure did.

I'm hungry J. F.

I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?

I was hoping you'd say that.

[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]

Do you live in this building all by yourself?

Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)

(cough).

Watch out for the water.

Must get lonely here J. F.

Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?

No.

Yoo-hoo, home again.

Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.

Good evening, fellas.

Toy 1: Oooh!

They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?

I'm sort of an orphan.

Oh, what about your friends?

I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tommorrow.

Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Deckard uses the machine thing]

Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.

[Market]

Fish?

I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.

Snake?

Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.

[Abdul Hassan's]

Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?

My work? Not too many could afford such quality.

How many?

Very few.

How few? Look my friend.

Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.

[Taffy Lewis's]

Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

Blow me.

You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?

All the time, pal.

Every see this girl, huh?

Never seen her, buzz off.

Your licenses in order pal?

Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.

[Deckard calls Rachel on a public videophone.]

Hello?

I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?

I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.

Go someplace else?

[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]

Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.

[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]

Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.

Oh, yeah?

I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.

Committee of Moral Abuses?

Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.

I don't know nothing about it.

Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?

How do you mean, exploited?

Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?

Ha. Are you for real?

Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.

For what?

For, uh, for holes.

Holes?

You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.

No, I wouldn't.

Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?

Of course its not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?

Me.

You're a dedicated man.

[Fight and chase]

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.

Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...

Move! Get out of the way!

[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]

Deckard (voice-over): The report would be rountine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachel.

Deckard. B-263-54.

Street thing: Move on...

Yeah what do you want?

Tsing tao. This enough?

Yeah.

Bryant.

Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.

I'm going home.

You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.

Three. There's three to go.

There's four. That-- That skin job that you vacated at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachel. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brian implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

[Leon stops Deckard in the street]

Leon.

How old am I?

I don't know.

My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?

Four years.

More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

Oh, I agree.

Wake up! Time to die.

[Rachel pops some lead into Leon's cranium]

[Back at Deckard apartment]

Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.

I'm not in the business. I am the business.

[Deckard gurgles blood.]

What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?

No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.

Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?

They're classified.

But you're a policeman.

I didn't look at them.

You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?

[Deckard falls asleep while Rachel dis-hairs and plays the piano.]

I dreamt music.

I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if its me or Tyrell's niece.

You play beautifully.

[A little rough-housin']

Say kiss me.

I can't rely on.

Say kiss me.

Kiss me.

I want you.

I want you.

Again.

I want you. Put your hands on me.

[Sebastian's apartment.]

Whatcha doing?

Sorry, just peaking.

Oh.

How do I look?

You look better.

Just better?

Well, you look beautiful.

Thanks. (pause) How old are you?

Twenty-five.

What's you problem?

Methuselah's syndrome.

What's that?

My glands. They grow old too fast.

Is that why you're still on earth?

Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.

I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.

Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.

This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.

Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?

Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.

Well?

Leon--

What's going on.

Ah-- There's only two of us now.

Then we're stupid and we'll die.

No we won't.

[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]

No, knight takes queen, see. No good.

Why are you staring at us Sebastian?

Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.

Yes.

What generation are you?

Nexus six.

Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.

Like what?

Like anything.

We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.

I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.

Very good Pris, now show him why.

[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]

We've got a lot in common.

What do you mean?

Similar problems.

Accelerated decrepitude.

I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.

If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?

Who?

Your opponent.

Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.

Maybe he could help.

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.

Yes, very.

Will you help us?

I can't.

We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.

(Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.

I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.

[To Tyrell's house.]

66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--

New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.

At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.

Queen to Bishop 6. Check.

Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.

(whispered) Bishop to King 7.

Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.

Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.

Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.

I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

What can he do for you?

Can the maker repair what he makes.

Would you like to be modified?

Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.

What-- What seems to be the problem?

Death.

Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--

I want more life, fucker.

The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once its been established.

Why not?

Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.

What about EMS recombination.

We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.

Then a represive protein that blocks the operating cells.

Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.

But not to last.

The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

I've done questionable things.

Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.

Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gorged out.]

[On the street...]

Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---

This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?

I'm working. What are you doing?

Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.

I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored (<-- ???????).

Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and cleared. Have a better one.

[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]

Hello?

Hi, is J. F. there?

Who is it?

This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.

[Pris hangs up.]

Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.

[Deckard enters apartment.]

Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.

Toy 1: Oooh!

[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]

Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.

[Roy breaks through wall.]

Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.

Arrggh.

This is for Pris.

Arrgghh.

Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.

[Deckard fires again.]

Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...

Arrghhh.

[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]

(singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...

[Roy put stake though hand and screams.]

Yes...

[Roy puts head through wall.]

You better get it up, or I'm gonna hvae to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.

[Fight]

Yeah, that's the spirit.

[Deckard hits roy with pipe.]

That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?

[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]

Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.

[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the sholder of Orion. I watched sea beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.

Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.

You've done a mans job, sir. I guess your through, huh?

Finished.

Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?

Rachel? Rachel? Rachel?

[Deckard uncovers Rachel.]

Do you love me?

I love you.

Do you trust me?

I trust you.

Rachel?

[Deckard picks up paper unicorn.]

Gaff (memory): Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?

Deckard (voice-over): Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four
years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachel was
no termination date. I didn't know how long we had together,
who does?

The End


Blade Runner 2049

I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty.

I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

I don't mind the dirt.

I do mind...

...unannounced visits.

You police?

Are you Sapper Morton? Civic number NK68514?

- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

What do you farm?

It's a protein farm.

Wallace design.



Is that what I smell?

Grow that just for me.

Garlic.

Garlic.

Go on, try some.

No, thank you.

I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

How long you been here?

Since 2020.

But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

Your bag.

It's colonial medical use.

Military issue.

Where were you? Calantha?



Must have been brutal.

Plan on taking me in?

Let them take a look inside?

Mr. Morton...

...if taking you in is an option...

...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

I'm sorry it had to be me.

Good as any.

Now, if you don't mind...

...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

Please don't get up.

How's it feel killing your own kind?

I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

Only older models do.

And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

...because you've never seen a miracle.

Just photograph everything.

Madam, please.

Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

- I'll glue it.
- And?

One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

He looks like he could take your head off.

He tried.

He went AWOL after Calantha...

...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

- Just him?
- Just him.

Come on home for your baseline.

One moment, madam.

Thirty meters to maximum depth.

What is that?

I'll send a dig team.

Come on home before the storm.

Officer KD6 - 3.7.

- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

Recite your baseline.

And blood-black nothingness began to spin.

A system of cells interlinked within cells...

...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

Fuck off, skin-job.

And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

- Cells.
- Cells.

Have you ever been in an institution? Cells.

- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

Why don't you say that three times?

Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.

We're done.

Constant K.

You can pick up your bonus.

Thank you, sir.

Caution, keep clear.

Caution, keep clear.

Caution, keep clear.

Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

Packages start at 20 minutes.

Many options available.

Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

Connect to Off-world any time, any place.

Packages start at 20 minutes.

K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

You want me to come back?

- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

How was your meeting?

The usual.

How was your day?

I'm getting cabin fever.

99.9 percent detoxified water.

I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

I need a drink.

- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

Don't fuss.

I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

It was number one on the charts.

It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

I told you not to fuss.

And yet...

Voilà! Bon appétit.

I missed you, baby sweet.

Honey, it's beautiful.

Just put your feet up.

Relax.

Was a day?

It was a day.

Would you read to me?

It'll make you feel better.

- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

Let's dance.

Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

What present?

- This one.
- What's the occasion?

Let's just say...

- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

No, but let's just say that it is.

Okay?

Happy anniversary.

An emanator.

Thank you.

Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

Where do you wanna go first?

I'm so happy when I'm with you.

You don't have to say that.

The dig's come through. We have a new lead.

Get down here.

Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

...creatively repurposed
as an ossuary: a box of bones.

Nothing else in it but hair.

The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

"She"?

Cause of death, Coco?

No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

...a fracture through the ilium.

It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

She was pregnant?

So he didn't kill her?

She died in childbirth.

What's that?

Go back.

Closer.

Closer.

What's that?

Notching in the iliac crest.

It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

That looks like an emergency C-section.

The cuts are clean. No sign of a struggle.

He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

He didn't seem like the saving type.

He went to the trouble of burying her.

A sentimental skin-job.

Sorry.

So where's the kid?

You scan the whole field?

Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

Maybe he ate it.

That's not possible.

She was a Replicant.

Pregnant.

The world is built on a wall.

It separates kind.

Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

Or a slaughter.

So what you saw...

...didn't happen.

Yes, madam.

It is my job to keep order.

That's what we do here. We keep order.

You want it gone?

Erase everything.

- Even the child?
- All trace.

You have anything more to say?

I've never retired something
that was born before.

What's the difference?

To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

Are you telling me no?

I wasn't aware that was an option, madam.

Attaboy.

Hey. You've been getting on fine without one.

What's that, madam?

A soul.

And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

...because you've never seen a miracle.

Just checking in on an old serial number.

Confirmation DNA?

I got hair.

An old one.

Pre-Blackout.

That's gonna be tough.

Not much from then.

And what's there is...

...thick milky.

You can customize them as much as you'd like.

As human as you want them to be.

But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

That was a little before my time.

I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

Every machine stopped cold.

When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

Didn't mind that.

It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

Standard issue.

- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

Unremarkable.

"Unremarkable"?

There must be something else
we can find for him.

Another prodigal serial number returns.

A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

Thank you, officer.

I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

He named you.

Must be special.

I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

Follow me.

The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

...revivified the technology.

To say the least of what we do.

I see you're also a customer.

Are you satisfied with our product?

She's very realistic. Thank you.

Here. All the junk is in here.

Lucky for you, Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

No one's been down here in ages.

Sorry about that.

All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

But there are sometimes fragments.

You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

I'd take him to the doctor.

- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

Just answer the questions, please.

It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

This was a test.

We were difficult to spot then.

Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

To warrant an official investigation?

You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

She likes him.

Who?

This Officer Deckard.

She's trying to provoke him.

It is invigorating being
asked personal questions.

Makes one feel...

...desired.

Do you enjoy your work, officer?

Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

You worked with Officer Deckard...

...back in the day.

What can you tell me about him?

He liked to work alone.

So did I.

So we worked together to keep it that way.

That was it.

Anything else you can tell me?

He wasn't long for this world.

How so?

Something in his eyes.

Any idea how I could contact him?

None.

He's nyugdíjas.

Retired.

What happened?

Probably got what he wanted.

To be alone.

Welcome back, sir.

You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

...without a gift.

Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

A new model.

Well, let us see her, then.

The first thought...

...one tends to fear...

...to preserve the clay.

It's fascinating.

Before we even know what we are...

...we fear to lose it.

Happy birthday.

Now, let's have a look at you.

We make angels...

...in the service of civilization.

Yes, there were bad angels once.

I make good angels now.

That is how I took us to nine new worlds.

Nine.

A child can count to nine on fingers.

We should own the stars.

Yes, sir.

Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

We lost our stomach for slaves...

...unless engineered.

But I can only make so many.

That barren pasture...

...empty...

...and salted...

...right here.

The dead space between the stars.

And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

Millions, so we can be trillions more.

We could storm Eden and retake her.

Tyrell's final trick:

Procreation.

Perfected, then lost.

But there is a child.

Bring it to me.

Sir.

The best angel of all.

Aren't you, Luv?

The man with the green jacket.

The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

Hi.

Hello, hello, A-Boy.

You alone?

It's fine.

Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

Oh, you don't even smile.

Didn't you hear your friends?

Don't you know what I am?

Yeah.

Guy eating rice.

What's that?

It's a tree.

Never seen a tree before.

It's pretty.

It's dead.

Now, who keeps a dead tree?

You're not gonna kill me, are you?

Depends. What's your model number?

Why don't you look under my eye and find out?

You don't like real girls.

Well, I'm always here.

Hi.

You can't take those.

Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

Hold this for me.

Yep. Here you go.

Coco is dead.

Bones are gone.

It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

I found that.

A sock?

- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

Anything else?

I burned everything else.

Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

I don't know yet.

Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

This breaks the world, K.

You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

All useful, but with you, I sometimes forget.

We didn't have any of you where I was a kid.

Do you remember anything?

Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

I have memories...

...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

Tell me one.

From when you were a kid.

I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

I have one about a toy that I had.

A wooden horse.

With an inscription underneath.

All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

So I run.

I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

Later on, those kids find me...

...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

That's it.

Little K, fighting for what's his.

It's a good one.

Look at me.

We're all just looking out
for something real.

What happens if I finish that?

Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

Check back in after DNAbase.

Officer KD6 - 3.7.

Request.

DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

Looking for anomalies.

You have the satcrystal backup?

Okay.

Run it raw.

Mere data makes a man.

A and C and T and G.

The alphabet of you. All from four symbols.

I'm only two:

One and zero.

Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

You don't prefer your madam?

You were listening.

Maybe.

You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

Six, 10 and 21.

There's nothing to tell.

How many times have you told me that story?

Your memory?

The date carved beneath.

Six, 10 and 21.

Coincidence?

A dangerous coincidence.

I always knew you were special.

Maybe this is how.

A child.

Of woman born.

Pushed into the world.

Wanted.

Loved.

Well, if it were true...

...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

It's okay to dream a little.

- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

Stop.

Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

They're identical. Translate.

A boy and a girl.

- It's impossible.
- Why?

Two people can't have identical DNA.

One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

It says the girl died there.

Genetic disorder.

Galatians Syndrome.

And the boy...

...disappears.

Where's the orphanage?

You wanna go for a ride?

Well, here we are.

Buckle up.

K?

K? K?

K? K? K?

Stay back.

Fire again.

Fire again.

Fire.

Two hundred feet to the east.

Fire.

Go north.

Fire.

Stop. Twenty degrees east.

Stop.

Zoom in.

Closer.

Oh, come on.

Get up.

Do your fucking job.

Find the child.

Watch the car.

Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

...where it's raining fire!

You're in here to work.

And if you're not working, I don't need you.

I don't need any of...

Hi.

The nickel is for the colonial ships.

Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

...to that grand life Off-world.

And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

...and it makes them nimble, right?

But it's work.

It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

So come on, now.

What sort do you have in mind?

Because I got all kinds.

- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

And they were men, at that.

A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

I need to see your records.

Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

Don't keep records that far back.

- You don't?
- I don't.

Sorry.

Can't help you.

- You can't?
- Nope.

I think you can.

I think someone like you keeps a long memory.

Now you can tell me what you remember or
I can put a hole right here and take a look.

They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

Are you coming?

Where is it?

Oh, God.

Where, where, where?

I don't see it. Here.

It's gone.

It's the entire year.

I didn't do that.

That wasn't me.

I didn't. Wasn't me.

I always told you.

You're special.

Born.

Not made.

Hidden with care.

A real boy now.

A real boy needs a real name.

Joe.

"Joe"?

You're too important for K.

Your mother would've named you.

Joe.

- Joe.
- Stop.

How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

Who makes the memories?

Dr. Ana Stelline?

A visitor.

Is that okay?

Yes.

It's just unusual.

Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

Sorry. It's a compromised immune system.

A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

So it was a new life for me.

And they put me in my cage...

...filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

What can I help you with?

Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

Do you mind if I work while you talk?

Of course.

I promise I hear every word.

They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

Well, then, they're kind.

I love birthday parties.

You work for Wallace?

Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

He offered to buy me out, but I take
my freedom where I can find it.

Why are you so good?

What makes your memories so authentic?

Well, there's a bit
of every artist in their work.

But I was locked in a sterile chamber at 8...

...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

Got very good at imagining.

Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

I think it's only kind.

Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

I can't help your future...

...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

It's nice.

It's better than nice. It feels authentic.

And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

Wouldn't you agree?

Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

How can you tell the difference?

Can you tell if something...

...really happened?

They all think it's about more detail.

But that's not how memory works.

We recall with our feelings.

Anything real should be a mess.

I can show you.

Sit.

Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

Not even that hard. Just picture it.

Let it play.

Someone lived this, yes.

This happened.

I know it's real.

I know it's real.

Goddamn it!

Officer KD6 - 3.7. Madam is calling you in.

You're under arrest.

Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

- Cells.
- Cells.

Have you ever been in an institution? Cells.

When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

What's it like to be filled
with dread? Dreadfully.

Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

You're not even close to baseline.

Out! And close the door.

What the fuck is with you?

I put you on a case.

I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

He was set up like a standard
Replicant, put on a service job.

Even he didn't know who he was.

- And?
- And it's done.

- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

It's done.

Fuck.

You just stopped a bomb from going off.

You did good.

I can help you get out of this station alive
but you have 48 hours to get back on track.

Surrender your gun and badge.

And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

Thank you, madam.

You were right.

You were right about everything.

Thought you weren't interested, worky man.

You liked her. I could tell.

It's okay.

She's real.

I wanna be real for you.

You are real for me.

You have a special lady here.

Okay.

Let's do it.

Look at you.

Quiet now, I have to sync.

Joi is anything you want her to be.

Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

99.9 percent detoxified water.

It's from a tree.

I'm done with you.

You can go now.

Quiet now.

I've been inside you.

Not so much there as you think.

Coffee?

They'll be coming after me soon.

I'm coming with you.

But not like this.

If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

You have to delete me from the console.

My present.

Put me there.

I can't do that.

Think about it:

If anything happens to this, that's it.

You're gone.

Yes.

Like a real girl.

Please.

Joe, please.

I want this.

But I can't do it myself.

Break the antenna.

I don't need a real horse.

I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

Radiation from a reactor?

It matches a dirty bomb.

There's only one place that dirty.

Nobody lives there.

Go to five.

Four, 30 degrees to the left.

Tilt up.

Elevate to 400 feet.

Radiation analysis.

Move forward.

Tilt up.

Stop.

Move forward.

Go to five.

Seven, move forward.

Six.

Stop.

Go to seven.

Eight.

Nine.

Heat analysis.

Life.

What is it?

Guess we're about to find out.

Too dark in here.

I like him.

He's a good boy.

Where is he?

I have no idea. He's off-duty.

Check around.

I checked...

...anywhere a good boy might go.

You're too late.

It's gone.

He destroyed it.

Everything about it.

Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

You tiny thing.

In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

For fear of great change?

You can't hold the tide with a broom.

Except that I did.

Where is he?!

You're so sure.

Because he told you.

Because we never lie.

I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

So I had to kill you.

Then do what you gotta do.

Madam.

Officer KD6 - 3.7.

Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

Would you, boy?

Treasure Island?

He reads.

That's good.

Me too.

Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

Many is the night I dream of cheese...

...toasted, mostly.

What are you doing here?

I heard the piano.

Don't lie.

It's rude.

You're a cop.

- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

Then, what?

I just have some questions.

What questions?

Stay.

Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

But you're not making it easy.

I like this song.

We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

I'll take the drink.

This is really something.

The whole town was something.

One time.

Forget your troubles...

...see a show...

...gamble a little.

Win some money, lose some money.

They made money seem like candy.

You like whiskey?

I've got millions...

...of bottles of whiskey.

Here.

Bleeding.

Is it real?

I don't know.

Ask him.

You got a name?

Officer KD6 - 3.7...

That's not a name. That's a serial number.

All right.

Joe.

What do you want, Joe?

- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

What was she like?

- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

I had your job. I was good at it.

- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

What's her name?

Rachael.

Her name was Rachael.

What happened to the kid?

Who put it in the orphanage? Was it you?

I was long gone by then.

You didn't even meet your own kid?

Why?

Because that was the plan.

I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

Everyone had a part. Mine was to leave.

Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

- Did you want to?
- Not really.

- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

I didn't want our child found...

...taken apart, dissected.

Sometimes, to love someone...

...you gotta be a stranger.

To strangers.

What'd you do?

Who'd you bring?

- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

Target locked.

They know you're here.

I came alone.

Bad dog.

Stop.

I do hope you're satisfied with our product.

I love...

Hey, there's someone who wants to meet you.

You can trust us.

You must want me to look up and to the left.

This is Freysa.

She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

I recognize you.

Did you help him hide the child?

I was there.

I saw a miracle delivered.

A perfect little face crying up at me.

Mad as thunder.

Were you with her?

Rachael?

I held her as she died.

We hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret.

That's why Sapper let you kill him.

I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

If a baby can come from one of us...

...we are our own masters.

More human than humans.

A revolution is coming.

And we're building an army.

I want to free our people.

If you want to be free...

...join us.

Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

You led Wallace to Deckard.

You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

You must kill Deckard.

Deckard only wanted his baby to be safe.

And she is.

When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

...and she will lead our army.

"She"?

Of course.

Rachael had a daughter.

With my own eyes, I saw her come.

I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

It was a boy that you hid.

That is just a piece of the puzzle.

You imagined it was you?

You did.

You did.

We all wish it was us.

That's why we believe.

Someone lived this, yes.

I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

With my own eyes, I saw her come.

I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

There's a bit of every artist in their work.

Always jumping, that one.

Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

I have wanted to meet you for so very long.

You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

I had the lock.

I found the key.

Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

I need the specimen to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

The child.

I need the child.

To teach them all to fly.

And God remembered Rachel...

...heeded her and opened her womb.

Do you like our owl?

It's artificial?

Of course it is.

Must be expensive.

Very. I'm Rachael.

Deckard.

Is it the same...

...now, as then...

...the moment you met her?

All these years
you looked back on that day...

...drunk on the memory of its perfection.

How shiny her lips.

How instant your connection.

Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

All to make that single perfect specimen.

That is, if you were designed.

Love...

...or mathematical precision.

Yes.

No.

I know what's real.

It was very clever to keep
yourself empty of information...

...and all it cost you was everything.

But you can still help me.

You had help in the hiding.

Where did they go?

I know you know something.

Help me...

...and very, very good things
can come to you.

You don't have children...

...do you?

Oh, I have millions.

You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

Only I know...

...you love pain.

Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real.

More joy, then.

Do not be afraid.

An angel...

...made again.

For you.

Did you miss me?

Don't you love me?

Her eyes were green.

Off-world...

...I have everything I need to make you talk.

You do not know what pain is yet.

You will learn.

Hello, handsome.

What a day.

You look lonely.

I can fix that.

You look like a good joe.

Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

Because you've never seen a miracle.

You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

Confirm your identity.

Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

Space, this is 0-6.

Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

Where are we going?

Home.

Drive two down.

Backup engaged.

Warning.

- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

Take us back!

Get us up.

Open the door.

I'm the best one.

Off-world is waiting.

Joe. Joe!

Joe!

You should have let me die out there.

You did.

You drowned out there.

You're free to meet your daughter now.

All the best memories are hers.

Why?

Who am I to you?

Go meet your daughter.

You okay?

Just a moment.

Beautiful, isn't it?

The End
